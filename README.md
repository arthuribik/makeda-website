## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
The website uses a black and white color scheme defined in `tailwind.config.js`:
- Primary: Black (#000000)
- Secondary: White (#ffffff)
- Accent: Gray variations

### Images
All images are sourced from Unsplash and can be easily replaced by updating the image URLs in the component files.

### Content
All content is currently hardcoded in the components. For CMS integration with Strapi, you'll need to:
1. Set up a Strapi backend
2. Create content types for each section
3. Replace hardcoded content with API calls
